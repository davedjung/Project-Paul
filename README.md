Number of particles: 1000<br />
Temperature scale: 2<br />
100x faster than version alpha, but real-time simulation is still unattainable. Time-lapse video of 12-hour-long screen capture.

Accurate calculation in terms of physics, but a significant portion of collisions is ignored. Real-time simulation achieved.
